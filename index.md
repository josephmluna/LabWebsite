# Unraveling viral secrets through RNA biology
The Luna Lab is a team of molecular biologists and virologists dedicated to understanding how RNA-binding proteins orchestrate cellular responses during viral infections. We use RNA viruses as tools to uncover fundamental principles of RNA biology and develop potential therapeutic strategies viral diseases, RNA-related disorders, and more. We use a wide array of tools including reverse genetics, functional genomics, advanced RNA profiling techniques, and innovative subcellular imaging methods. Current work focuses on mapping the dynamic spatial interactions between viral genomes and host factors, decoding the regulatory logic of RNA-protein networks, and developing novel tools to study RNA biology at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.
