Edith Barlin is a senior Biochemistry major from Downers Grove, Illinois. She is investigating human platelet lysate as a potential fetal bovine serum replacement in cell culture. When not in the lab, you can find her directing her second musical with CWRU Footlighters or writing for The Athenian, the satire newspaper. After undergrad, she wants to get a PhD and be the scientist she wanted to be when she was younger, one that creates treatments for diseases and uses cool looking machines.
