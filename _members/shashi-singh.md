Shashi Shekhar Singh received his M.Sc. in Biotechnology and Ph.D. in Molecular Biology
and Biochemistry from Jawaharlal Nehru University, India, in 2019, under the mentorship of
Prof. Sudha Bhattacharya. His doctoral research revealed the multifaceted role of the enzyme
Rrp6 in RNA homeostasis and stress response in Entamoeba histolytica, contributing to a deeper
understanding of parasitic biology and RNA dynamics.

As a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Srinivasan Dasarathy at the Cleveland Clinic, Shashi
investigated cellular stress responses, particularly focusing on hyperammonemia's effects on
skeletal muscle protein homeostasis. His research uncovered novel roles of RhBG, an ammonia
transporter that also acts as a transceptor, mediating intracellular transport and activating NFκB
signaling. This discovery provides valuable insights for developing therapeutic strategies
targeting chronic diseases. In 2022, Shashi cross-linked to the Luna Lab, where he currently
explores RNA editing, particularly ADAR-based programmable A-to-I editing, to modulate gene
expression and protein function by altering pre-mRNA splicing or recoding at the amino acid
level. Additionally, with collaboration he develops innovative tools to map RNA-protein
interactions with spatial precision, advancing the understanding of subcellular RNA-protein
dynamics.

Shashi is deeply committed to mentoring aspiring scientists and advancing RNA biology.
Outside the lab, Shashi swaps pipettes for hiking boots—because why map just RNA-protein
interactions when you can aim to map every trail in America? When he’s not out in nature, he
fine-tunes his yoga poses with the same precision he brings to RNA editing in the lab and spends
quality time with his wife, son, and loved ones back in India, keeping his signaling pathways for
laughter and connection active.
