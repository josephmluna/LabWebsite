Hi! I am Saad and I built the first version of this website! I was a Biology major at CWRU (class of 2024) and am now attending medical school at Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED). In the Luna lab, I worked on developing cell segmentation pipelines for live-cell imaging to quantify dynamic stress repsonses in cells.
