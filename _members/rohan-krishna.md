Rohan is a PHD student studying the modularity and evolutionary significance of RNA recognition motifs found in RNA binding proteins. He received his B.S. in Biology in 2023 from Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California. Prior to graduate school, he worked as a technologist at Sandia National Laboratories for 1.5 years working on bacteriophage defense systems and developed binding assays for host response biomarker detection using a mix of computational and wet-lab techniques. 

Outside of the lab, Rohan enjoys playing board/video games, eating good food, and spending time with family and friends.
